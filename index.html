        <h1>Web Developement Jobs</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Finding your competitive edge over other Web Design can be quite difficult, as using HTML and CSS are not the most complicated things to do. 
        You have to have a deep knowledge of both and of most front-end development tools, and as much practice as possible, to make sure that you 
        can meet the demands of employers and be sought out. Having personal projects also helps tremendously, by having the ability to show any 
        potential employer your skills with web design, at any stage in your career. The importance placed on related degrees to web design has slowly 
        started shifting, with a bachelors being the most you will need, and some companies are not even requiring one anymore if the right skills and 
        experience are possessed. Having a higher level of education (PhD, Masters, etc.) only helps if the web designer is searching for a specific
         position, that may require that degree, although pay does not really get affected. The one part of education that becomes very imperative 
         though, is the self-education that a designer has to keep up on. They must self-educate themselves as new technology appears and changes 
         every 2-3 years, so a designer should really focus on understanding these changes and how it could impact their jobs or future careers. 
         At the beginning of a designers career, potential jobs could be Junior FE developers, Junior Designer, or Junior User Experience Engineer, 
         or some mid-level job if the designer has prior experience. At these jobs the employee is expected to ask meaningful questions, understand 
         the basics of front-end development, and be a good absorber of knowledge. The types of companies that hire these junior designers spans 
         anywhere from startups who do not make a lot of money, and have a high workload, all the way to Fortune 500 companies, or alternatively you 
         can do freelancing. Average starting salaries vary depending on the position and location, but on average most junior designers/developers
         /dev ops, etc. will see between 45-100k depending on location, as a starting salary. The expectation is that out of college not many web 
         designers will make 6 figures, however within 4-5 years those salaries do grow to very well-paying jobs, who are generally higher paying 
         than most. Once you have applied it is expected that you show up on time and act cordial in the interview, ready to demonstrate your knowledge 
         with technical things, or even coding segments, it is also expected that you ask as many questions as possible. If you get the job, the 
         first week you should familiarize yourself with the job, the project you have been assigned to, and learning about the people you will be working 
         with. Within the first month, it is expected that you have been settled, and everything is set up (insurance, equipment, role, etc.), but it 
         is still important to ask questions, and take in as much knowledge as possible. In the first year, you should not expect a promotion, but you 
         should look for opportunities to take on leadership positions wherever viable, working as a junior usually means that for 2-3 years you will 
         most likely not get promoted.</p></main>
